# aoc

This is my solutions repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I solve for fun (i.e. usually not as soon as the puzzles are released). I try not to brute-force my solutions, but I'm also not trying to optimize the living hell out of them either. Sometimes I'll write a working solution and move on from it, then return to it later to implement a better approach.

My puzzle solutions are located in `aoc/lib/<year>`. To run the code for a specific day, e.g. Day 1 of 2020, use `bin/run 2020/01`.

As of December 2024, all of my solutions are written in Ruby. I previously made use of [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli), which is a fine tool, but found it to be slightly unwieldy for my workflow. My current setup is based heavily on `ahorner`'s [advent-of-code](https://github.com/ahorner) repo. I've modified a few things, and my transition is still in progress, but [Mr. Horner](https://github.com/ahorner) deserves all the credit for this sleek setup.
