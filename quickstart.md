# quickstart

## what is this
I do a lot of intermittent solving for Advent of Code. I started using this configuration in December 2024, but I modified someone else's, which means that I'm not as familiar with the implementation details as I would be if I built it from scratch.

So, I sometimes forget which commands to run and what files I should navigate to as my entry points.

## example: 2020, day 3
1. `$ bin/start 2020/03`
2. Add example input from [write up](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)
3. Write solution in lib/2020/03.rb
3. `$ rspec spec/2020/03_spec.rb`
